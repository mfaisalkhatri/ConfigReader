**How to use this Framework:**
01. Add the following dependency in your pom.xml file: 

```<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.mfaisalkhatri/configreader -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mfaisalkhatri</groupId>
    <artifactId>configreader</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

02. Reading "Config.Properties" is made much simple and easy now. Check the sample code and tests below:
```
This is the config file extract: 
searchtext=Apple iphone 8
```

03. Once the dependency jar is downloaded in project, Use "PropertiesReader" class and get the values from the properties file in below defined way:
```
@Test
	public void Test() throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, Throwable {

		PropertiesReader prop = new PropertiesReader();
		String srch = prop.getKey("searchtext");
		
		System.out.println("Value of search text key is: " +srch);
		Assert.assertEquals(srch, "Apple iphone 8");

	}
```

**In the above case, Getter/Setter can also be created to get values from the properties file.**
**Exceptions have been handled while reading file or when file is not found, so you don't have to worry, if any thing goes wrong in tests.**
**Appropriate logs will be generated in project folder when exception is caught.**
